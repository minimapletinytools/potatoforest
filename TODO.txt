- consider changing how time works (maybe make it an INPUT parameter instead of requires)
  - can you allow other things to be treated like time to make it less special?

:: PARSER TODO ::
-high priority
  -fix `manyTill _ reservedWord` parsing, it's broke af
  -should recognize any all caps word at the beginning of a line as a keyword
  -easy way to fix is to require item descriptions to be in one line or to be in quotation marks
-mid priority
  -fix show instances of recipes and starting items so that they don't show the items all over again
  -do variable name cleanup in parsers (maybe make new modules?)
-low priority
  -figure out what default deriving on Item and Recipe didn't work as expected
  -figure out how to derive Default instance rather than defining your own
