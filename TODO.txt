:: TODO TMRW ::
DONE-add tests for untested stuff in Types.hs
DONE-slight cleanup in parser tests
-try out basic reflex stuff

:: REFLEX TODO ::
DONE-remove commond and backend, add potato forest
-switch frontend to use hpack instead of cabal D:

:: OTHER TODO ::
IGNORE/FAIL-consider changing how time works (maybe make it an INPUT parameter instead of requires)
  -can you allow other things to be treated like time to make it less special?

-add parsing for infinity keyword
-add STARTING parsing as part of item parsing and remove the other STARTING parsing

:: PARSER TODO ::
-high priority
  -fix `manyTill _ reservedWord` parsing, it's broke af
  -should recognize any all caps word at the beginning of a line as a keyword
  -easy way to fix is to require item descriptions to be in one line or to be in quotation marks
-mid priority
  -fix show instances of recipes and starting items so that they don't show the items all over again
  -do variable name cleanup in parsers (maybe make new modules?)
-low priority
  -allow something like "INCLUDE helper.spec" sorta commands
    -the implementation should parse the files separately passing the state between them D:
  -figure out what default deriving on Item and Recipe didn't work as expected
  -figure out how to derive Default instance rather than defining your own
