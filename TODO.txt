- consider changing how time works (maybe make it an INPUT parameter instead of requires)
  - can you allow other things to be treated like time to make it less special?
- fix show instances of recipes and starting items so that they don't show the items all over again

- do variable name cleanup in parsers (maybe make new modules?)

-use of `manyTill _ reservedWord` will break on comments I think
  -fix it :O
  -just go until it hits an all caps word rather than reserved one
-figure out what default deriving on Item and Recipe didn't work as expected
-figure out how to derive Default instance rather than defining your own
